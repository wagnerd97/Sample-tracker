This guide will hopefully be informative enough to allow the continuing maintenance of this project.

April 2024, this project was converted to a Maven project because it was otherwise broken.

Also because our TrackerGUI class extends Application, that also breaks stuff. so a Launcher class is now the main class to allow us to
still build properly.

to build the jar file, Build -> Build artifacts... -> SampleTracker:jar -> rebuild

the output will go to target -> artifacts -> SampleTracker_jar

then we need to turn that SampleTracker.jar file into an msi installer

we do that using jpackage. which is bundled into the java sdk these days.

we can open powershell to this SampleTracker_jar folder and run this command:

jpackage --type msi --app-version "1.0.2" --input . --dest . --main-jar .\SampleTracker.jar --main-class org.openjfx.TrackerGUI --win-shortcut --win-menu --icon "TrackerIcon.ico" --name "Tracker" --jlink-options --bind-services

we do need to adjust the --app-version accordingly.

then this installer can be double clicked to install. although we should likely uninstall any old versions before installing the new one

Sometimes things will get screwed up and it won't compile. on the right side there should be a little button for the maven
tools. SampleTracker -> lifecycle -> install should allow you to fix a lot of issues
